        title: 'Huawei is about to unveil the Mate 30, its first flagship phone without Google services',
        article: 'Huawei is about to find out just how important the Google ecosystem is to its global smartphone business.The Chinese tech company will launch its latest smartphone, the Mate 30, in Munich on Thursday. It is Huawei\'s first smartphone series to hit the market since being put on a trade blacklist by the United States back in May, cutting off its new products from access to Google apps and services. The Mate 30 phones will come with Googles open source Android operating system, but won\'t have access to the Google Play Store or apps like YouTube, Gmail and Google Maps. Third party apps like ride-hailing platforms and food delivery services that rely on Google Maps would also no longer function without access to Google services.'

        title: 'Tesla takes on Porsche with superfast Plaid Mode',
        article: 'When Porsche said it set a speed record with its new Taycan electric car, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, wasn\'t about to just sit there and take it. He quickly tweeted that Tesla has something in the works that would enable its cars to outdo even Porsche. It\'s called Plaid Mode. Many Tesla (TSLA) cars already offer Ludicrous Mode, which is quicker than the previously available Insane Mode. Using Ludicrous Mode, a Tesla Model S can scurry from a dead stop to 60 miles an hour in less than 2.5 seconds. Plaid Mode will be faster than Ludicrous Mode and is expected to be available in about a year. It will use three electric motors rather than the two currently in vehicles equipped with Ludicrous, and will be available on Tesla\'s Model S, X and, later, in the Roadster, Musk has Tweeted.'

        title: 'Yo, ho, ho! International Talk Like a Pirate Day is upon us!',
        article: 'Aye maties, \'tis the day we\'ve all been waiting for: International Talk Like a Pirate Day. But avast! Before you grab your grog and parrot, let\'s get ye educated! The idea for the day was born in 1995 on a YMCA racquetball court in Albany, Oregon. John "Ol\' Chumbucket" Baur and his friend Mark "Cap\'n Slappy" Summers began throwing around insults, just like pirates. They selected September 19, simply because Summers had recently divorced, it was his ex-wife\'s birthday, and he figured "the date was stuck in my head, and I wasn\'t going to do anything with it anymore," he told CNN in 2009. But it wasn\'t until humorist Dave Barry caught wind of the idea and threw his support behind it in a September 2002 Miami Herald column that this rickety ship took sail. "As the name suggests, this is a day on which everybody would talk like a pirate. Is that a great idea, or what?" Barry wrote back then. "There are so many practical benefits that I can\'t even begin to list them all."'

        title: 'Jerry Seinfeld wins copyright lawsuit over Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee',
        article: 'A former colleague claimed he had originally pitched the idea for Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. Christian Charles said he had first suggested the format to Seinfeld in 2002 - a decade before it debuted. But Manhattan District judge Alison Nathan said Charles had taken too long to sue, as the statute of limitations was three years. Charles had waited for six years to file his lawsuit after Seinfeld rejected his copyright claim in 2012, the year the first series of the show aired. "Today\'s victory is a complete vindication," Seinfeld\'s lawyer, Orin Snyder, said in a statement. "Jerry created Comedians in Cars and this lawsuit was nothing but a money-grab seeking to capitalise on the success of the show. We are pleased that the court saw through the noise." Charles claimed his proposed project, Two Stupid Guys in a Stupid Car Driving to a Stupid Town, was pitched in 2002 to Seinfeld, with whom he had worked since 1994. The pilot for Comedians in Cars was directed by Charles in October 2011, but the pair\'s relationship was said to have broken down after Charles sought more credit and compensation than Seinfeld wanted to give. "We are, of course, disappointed,\" Peter Skolnik, a lawyer for Charles, said in a statement to Reuters. He also criticised Seinfeld\'s alleged " egregious, shabby conduct ".'

        title: 'How podcasts went from unlistenable to unmissable',
        article: 'He filed the piece and then, just as he was packing up, got a last minute call from the subs desk (the team that give stories a final check). "They said: \'We need one more sentence - just to fill the page,\'" the British writer says. \"So I wrote something pompous like: \'And what should we call this new phenomenon - audioblogs? How about podcasts?\'" A few months later Ben received a call from the Oxford English Dictionary. They said they couldn\'t find any earlier citation of the word \"podcast\" and asked if he had really made it up? Yes, he had. Podcasts may not have been born that evening - but they had been christened. A decade and a half later, what had been a motley collection of what Mr Hammersley calls "mostly unlistenable" MP3 recordings has become a global industry.'
